[Chinese version of this README](https://github.com/MisterBooo/LeetCodeAnimation/blob/master/README-zh.md)

I will do my best to demonstrate all the questions on LeetCode in the form of animation. 

I plan to take three to four years to complete it!

I look forward to witnessing this day with you!

In order to better perform LeetCode animation, i am working hard to learn more data structures and algorithms.

I am currently writing an article titled "Animated Illustrated Data Structures" and will continue to update this repository after finishing that series.
